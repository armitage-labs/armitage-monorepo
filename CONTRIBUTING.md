# Welcome to GitHub docs contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on [https://armitage.xyz](https://armitage.xyz) :sparkles:.

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.


## Getting started


### Issues

#### Before writing code

If you’re interested in adding a new feature, consider opening an issue suggesting it. Then, we can discuss the feature to make sure that everyone is on board.

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue.

If you find an issue that you’re interested in addressing, consider adding a comment to that effect. This way, we can let you know if the issue has gone stale before you put too much work into it, and other contributors can know to focus on other issues.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/github/docs/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See "[Label reference](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/collaborating-on-github-docs/label-reference)" for more information. As a general rule, we don’t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

We use the Github flow with an automated CICD, which means that whenever your code is merged on the `main` branch, it will be automatically deployed and it will update the production environment.
Therefore, specially now on the beginning of the project, you should expect that your PR will be tested locally by maintainers to ensure that it does not include any regressions or bugs.

We will soon introduce a test suite to run on the pipeline.

### This is a work in progress.

Expect this CONTRIBUTING document and all other related documents to be heavily changed on the coming weeks, we welcome contributions with that purpose.
